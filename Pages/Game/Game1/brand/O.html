                    <p>Opel is a historic German automotive brand that has been producing vehicles since 1899. While
                        Opel was acquired by the French automaker Groupe PSA in 2017 (now part of Stellantis), it still
                        maintains its distinct identity and heritage.<br><br>

                        Opel offers a diverse range of cars, SUVs, and vans, targeting various market segments. Their
                        lineup includes models like the Opel Corsa, Opel Astra, Opel Crossland, and Opel Grandland X,
                        among others.<br><br>

                        Opel vehicles are known for their German engineering, practicality, and value for money. They
                        often feature efficient engines, comfortable interiors, and a good balance between performance
                        and fuel economy. Opel focuses on delivering a smooth and enjoyable driving experience while
                        emphasizing safety and connectivity features.</p>
