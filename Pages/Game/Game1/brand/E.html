                <div class="brand-info">
                    <p>Eagle was an American automotive brand that was active from 1988 to 1998. The brand was a
                        division of the Chrysler Corporation and aimed to offer sporty and performance-oriented vehicles
                        to the market.<br>

                        Eagle vehicles were primarily rebadged versions of existing models from other Chrysler brands,
                        such as Mitsubishi and AMC. The lineup included compact cars, sedans, and even a few sports
                        cars. One notable model was the Eagle Talon, which was a collaboration with Mitsubishi and
                        featured turbocharged engines and all-wheel drive.<br>

                        Despite its relatively short lifespan, Eagle gained a following for its sporty and distinctive
                        offerings. However, due to various factors including market competition and changes in consumer
                        preferences, the Eagle brand was discontinued in 1998.
                        Today, while Eagle as a brand no longer exists, some of its models still hold a nostalgic appeal
                        for automotive enthusiasts and collectors.</p>
