                    <p>A windshield, also known as a windscreen in some Commonwealth countries, is a transparent screen that protects the occupants of a vehicle from the elements. It is typically made of laminated safety glass, which is made up of two layers of glass with a layer of plastic sandwiched in between. The plastic layer helps to hold the glass together in the event of a crack or break.<br><br>

                        Windshields are an important safety feature in vehicles. They help to protect the occupants from flying debris, rocks, and other objects that may be kicked up by the tires. They also help to keep the rain and snow out of the vehicle, which can improve visibility and prevent accidents.<br></br></p>
