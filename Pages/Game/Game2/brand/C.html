                    <p>A carburetor is a device used in internal combustion engines to mix air and fuel in the correct proportion for combustion. It delivers the air-fuel mixture to the engine's cylinders for combustion and power generation.

                     <p>   Fuel Delivery: Carburetors were commonly used in older vehicles before the advent of fuel injection systems. They use the Venturi effect to create a pressure difference that draws fuel from the fuel tank and mixes it with the incoming air.
                        
                        Components: The main components of a carburetor include the throttle valve, choke, float chamber, main jet, idle jet, and various passages and nozzles. These components work together to regulate the amount of fuel and air entering the engine.
                        
                        Idle and Acceleration: The idle circuit of the carburetor controls the fuel and air mixture when the engine is at idle or low speeds. The acceleration circuit enriches the mixture during quick throttle movements to prevent hesitation or stumbling.<br></br>
