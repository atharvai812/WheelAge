                    <p>In automotive engineering, a manifold is a component that allows multiple components to connect to each other. There are two main types of car manifolds: intake manifolds and exhaust manifolds.<br><br>

                        Intake manifolds deliver the air-fuel mixture to the cylinders. They are typically made of aluminum or plastic, and they have a number of tubes or runners that connect to the individual cylinders.<br><br>

                        Exhaust manifolds collect the exhaust gases from the cylinders and route them to the exhaust pipe. They are typically made of cast iron or stainless steel, and they have a number of pipes or tubes that connect to the individual cylinders.</p>
