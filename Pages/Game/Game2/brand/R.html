                    <p>An automobile radiator is a heat exchanger that is used to cool the engine of a car. It is typically located in the front of the car, and it is made up of a series of tubes and fins. The coolant, which is a mixture of water and antifreeze, flows through the tubes, and the air that passes through the fins helps to cool the coolant.<br><br>

                        The radiator is an important part of the car's cooling system. If the radiator is not working properly, the engine can overheat, which can cause serious damage.<br><br>

                        functions of an automobile radiator:<br></br>

Cooling the engine<br></br>
Maintaining the coolant temperature<br></br>
Preventing the coolant from boiling</p>
