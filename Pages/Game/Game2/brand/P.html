                    <p>A power steering pump is a hydraulic pump that assists in the operation of a vehicle's steering system, making it easier for the driver to turn the steering wheel.<br><br>

                        Function: The primary function of a power steering pump is to generate hydraulic pressure and supply power steering fluid to the steering gear or rack. This pressurized fluid helps reduce the effort required to turn the steering wheel, particularly at low speeds and during maneuvers.<br><br>

                        Hydraulic System: Power steering systems typically consist of a power steering pump, power steering fluid reservoir, hydraulic lines, and a steering gear or rack. The power steering pump is driven by the engine via a belt or pulley system.</p>
