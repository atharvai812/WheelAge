                    <p>A keyless entry system (KES) is an electronic system that allows you to lock and unlock your car doors, trunk, and start the engine without having to use a physical key. <br><br>

                        KES systems typically consist of a small transmitter, called a key fob, that you carry with you. The key fob contains a radio transmitter that sends a coded signal to a receiver unit in your car. When the receiver unit receives the signal, it unlocks the doors or starts the engine.<br></br>
                        KES systems offer a number of conveniences over traditional key systems. You don't have to fumble with your keys when you're getting in and out of your car, and you can start your car without having to take your keys out of your pocket. KES systems can also be programmed to perform other functions, such as rolling down the windows or setting the alarm.</p>
