                    <p>A yaw rate sensor, also known as a rotational speed sensor or a stability control sensor, is a component in a vehicle's electronic stability control (ESC) system. It measures the yaw rate, or the rotational movement around the vertical axis, of the vehicle.<br></br>

                        The primary function of a yaw rate sensor is to detect and monitor the rotational motion of the vehicle around its vertical axis, also known as yaw. It measures the rate of change of the vehicle's heading, providing crucial information about its stability and handling.
                        ESC System: Yaw rate sensors are an integral part of the electronic stability control (ESC) system. The ESC system is designed to help improve vehicle stability and prevent loss of control during abrupt maneuvers, such as cornering or evasive maneuvers.<br></br></p>
