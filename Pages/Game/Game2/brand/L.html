                    <p>Car lug nuts are the fasteners that secure the wheels to the wheel hub of a vehicle. They play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and safety of the wheel assembly.<br><br>

                        Lug nuts serve to securely attach the wheels to the wheel hub, ensuring they remain in place while the vehicle is in motion. They help distribute the load evenly across the wheel mounting surface and prevent the wheels from loosening or detaching.<br><br>
                        There are different types of lug nuts, including:
                        <br></br>
a. Conical Seat Lug Nuts<br></br>

b. Spherical Seat Lug Nuts<br></br>

c. Flat Seat Lug Nuts <p></p>
