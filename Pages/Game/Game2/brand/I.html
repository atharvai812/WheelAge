                    <p>An ignition coil is an essential component in the ignition system of a vehicle. It is responsible for generating the high voltage needed to ignite the air-fuel mixture in the engine's combustion chambers.<br></br>

                        Function: The primary function of an ignition coil is to convert the low voltage from the vehicle's battery (typically 12 volts) into a high voltage (thousands of volts) needed to create a spark at the spark plugs.

Coil Construction: Ignition coils are typically composed of two coils of wire wrapped around a ferromagnetic core.<br></br>

Ignition Coil Types: There are two common types of ignition coils: conventional ignition coils and coil-on-plug (COP) ignition coils. Conventional ignition coils are located outside the engine and distribute the high voltage to the spark plugs via spark plug wires. COP ignition coils are mounted directly on the spark plugs, eliminating the need for spark plug wires.</p>
