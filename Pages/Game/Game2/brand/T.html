                    <p>A timing belt is a belt in an internal combustion engine that synchronizes the rotation of the crankshaft and the camshaft(s). The timing belt ensures that the valves open and close at the correct times in relation to the pistons. This is essential for the engine to operate properly.<br><br>

                        Timing belts are typically made of a rubber compound with high tensile strength. They have teeth on one side that mesh with the timing gears on the crankshaft and camshaft(s). The timing belt is driven by the crankshaft pulley, and it rotates the camshaft(s) at the same speed.<br><br>
                        Timing belts need to be replaced periodically, as they can stretch and wear out over time. If a timing belt breaks, it can cause the valves and pistons to collide, which can damage the engine.</p>
