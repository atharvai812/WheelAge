                    <p>Engine valves are vital components in the internal combustion engine that control the intake of air/fuel mixture and the exhaust of combustion gases. They play a crucial role in the engine's operation and performance.<br></br>

                        Engine valves are responsible for regulating the flow of air/fuel mixture into the combustion chamber during the intake stroke and allowing the exhaust gases to exit during the exhaust stroke. They open and close at specific times in coordination with the engine's piston movement.<br></br>

                        Types of Valves<br></br>
                        a. Intake Valves<br></br>
                        b. Exhaust Valves
