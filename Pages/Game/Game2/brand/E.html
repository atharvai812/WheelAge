                    <p>Car engines, also known as internal combustion engines, are the heart of vehicles and are responsible for generating power.<br>

                        Types of Engines: There are various types of car engines, but the most common ones are gasoline/petrol engines and diesel engines. Gasoline engines ignite a mixture of fuel and air, while diesel engines ignite fuel through compression.<br>
Cylinders: Engines typically have multiple cylinders arranged in a specific configuration. Common configurations include inline (straight), V-shaped, and horizontally opposed (boxer) engines. The number of cylinders can vary, with four, six, and eight cylinders being the most common.<br>
Engine Displacement: Engine displacement refers to the total volume swept by all the pistons inside the cylinders. It is usually measured in liters (L) or cubic centimeters (cc). Displacement affects an engine's power output and fuel consumption.
