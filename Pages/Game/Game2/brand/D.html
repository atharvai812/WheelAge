                    <p>A drive belt, also known as a serpentine belt or accessory belt, is an important component in a car's engine that transfers power from the engine crankshaft to various accessories and components.<br></br>

                        Function: The primary function of a drive belt is to transmit rotational power from the engine's crankshaft to drive auxiliary systems and accessories. It powers components such as the alternator, power steering pump, air conditioning compressor, water pump, and sometimes the cooling fan.<br><br>

                        Belt Type: Modern cars typically use a single, continuous serpentine belt that winds around various pulleys to drive multiple components. This design has largely replaced the older system of multiple belts for different accessories.

                        Belt Material: Drive belts are usually made of a durable and flexible rubber material, often reinforced with fiber cords or other materials to enhance strength and longevity.
