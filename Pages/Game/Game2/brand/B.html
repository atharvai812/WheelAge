                    <p>Function: Car batteries are rechargeable devices that provide electrical power to start the engine and supply electricity to various electrical components in the vehicle.

                     <p>   Voltage and Capacity: Most car batteries have a voltage rating of 12 volts. The capacity of a battery is measured in ampere-hours (Ah) or reserve capacity (RC), indicating the amount of charge the battery can deliver over a specific period.
                        
                        Types of Batteries: The most common type of car battery is the lead-acid battery. There are two subtypes: starting, lighting, and ignition (SLI) batteries, designed for short bursts of high current to start the engine, and deep cycle batteries, used for continuous power supply over longer periods.</p>
