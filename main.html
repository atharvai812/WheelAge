                        <p>The development of the modern automobile began in the late 19th century. Karl Benz is
                            credited with inventing the first practical automobile powered by an internal combustion
                            engine in 1886. This invention marked the beginning of the automotive industry.</p>

                        <h2>Mass Production:</h2>
                        <p>Henry Ford revolutionized the car industry with the introduction of the assembly line and
                            mass production techniques. In 1908, Ford introduced the Model T, which was affordable and
                            reliable. The assembly line significantly reduced production time and cost, making cars
                            accessible to the general public.</p>
